# Australian Tax Research — 2025-2026 Financial Year
**Date:** 2026-04-30
**Purpose:** Verify and update tax constants in the TaxCalc AU app

---

## 1. Income Tax Brackets and Rates (Residents)

**Status: No change from 2024-25.** Stage 3 tax cuts remain in place.

| Taxable Income | Tax on this Income |
|---|---|
| $0 - $18,200 | Nil |
| $18,201 - $45,000 | 16c for each $1 over $18,200 |
| $45,001 - $135,000 | $4,288 + 30c for each $1 over $45,000 |
| $135,001 - $190,000 | $31,288 + 37c for each $1 over $135,000 |
| $190,001 and over | $51,638 + 45c for each $1 over $190,000 |

**Future legislated changes:**
- 1 July 2026: 16% rate drops to **15%**
- 1 July 2027: 15% rate drops to **14%**

**App status:** Correct. No update needed.
**Verified against:** ATO rates page, CPA Australia Budget Report 2025-26.

---

## 2. Low Income Tax Offset (LITO)

**Status: No change from 2024-25.**

| Taxable Income | Offset Amount |
|---|---|
| $37,500 or less | $700 |
| $37,501 - $45,000 | $700 minus 5c for each $1 over $37,500 |
| $45,001 - $66,667 | $325 minus 1.5c for each $1 over $45,000 |
| $66,668 or more | Nil |

- LITO effectively raises the tax-free threshold from $18,200 to ~$22,575
- LMITO (Low and Middle Income Tax Offset) remains expired (ended after 2021-22)

**App status:** Correct. No update needed.
**Verified against:** ATO LITO page (published 16 June 2025), CPA Australia Budget Report 2025-26.

---

## 3. Medicare Levy

**Status: Rate unchanged at 2%. Thresholds unchanged for 2025-26.**

| Category | Low-income threshold (no levy) | Shade-in ends (full 2%) |
|---|---|---|
| Singles | $27,222 | $34,027 |
| Families (not SAPTO) | $45,907 (+ $4,216 per child) | $57,383 (+ $5,270 per child) |
| Single Seniors & Pensioners (SAPTO) | $43,020 | $53,775 |
| Families (Senior & Pensioner) | $59,886 (+ $4,216 per child) | $74,857 (+ $5,270 per child) |

The levy phases in at 10c per $1 above the lower threshold.

**Future change:** 2025-26 Budget announced increased Medicare levy low-income thresholds from 1 July 2026 (not 2025).

**App status:** Correct. No update needed.
**Verified against:** ATO M1 Medicare levy reduction 2025 instructions, William Buck Tax Rates 2025-26, ITP Tax Rates 2026.
**Note:** The ATO has not published a dedicated 2025-26 Medicare levy page yet (their myTax 2025 instructions are for the 2024-25 income year). However, the 2025-26 Budget only announced Medicare levy threshold increases from 1 July 2026 — not 2025. Multiple authoritative sources (William Buck, ITP, SuperGuide) confirm the thresholds remain at $27,222/$34,027 for 2025-26.

---

## 4. Medicare Levy Surcharge (MLS) Thresholds

**Status: Updated for 2025-26.**

| Tier | Singles | Families | Surcharge Rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Base (no surcharge) | $0 - $101,000 | $0 - $202,000 | 0% |
| Tier 1 | $101,001 - $118,000 | $202,001 - $236,000 | 1.0% |
| Tier 2 | $118,001 - $158,000 | $236,001 - $316,000 | 1.25% |
| Tier 3 | $158,001+ | $316,001+ | 1.5% |

Family thresholds increase by **$1,500** per dependent child after the first.

**Comparison with 2024-25:** Singles base was $97,000 (now $101,000). Families base was $194,000 (now $202,000).

**App status: NEEDS UPDATE.** Current code has Tier 1 ending at $117,000 and Tier 2 ending at $155,000 for singles. Correct values are $118,000 and $158,000. Family tiers similarly need updating ($234,000 -> $236,000, $310,000 -> $316,000).

## Gaps & Caveats

1. **ATO has not published a standalone 2025-26 Medicare levy thresholds page.** The ATO's Medicare levy reduction page (last updated 29 July 2025) does not specify the income year. The myTax 2025 instructions are for the 2024-25 income year. However, the 2025-26 Federal Budget only announced Medicare levy threshold increases from **1 July 2026**, and multiple authoritative accounting firms (William Buck, ITP, CPA Australia) confirm the thresholds remain at $27,222/$34,027 for 2025-26. **Risk: Low.**

2. **2024-25 PHI rebate rates in the app are also potentially stale.** The current app code for 2024-25 uses:
   - Period 1 (Jul-Mar): under65 base = 0.24608 (24.608%)
   - Period 2 (Apr-Jun): under65 base = 0.24288 (24.288%)
   
   The ATO confirms these are correct for 2024-25. **No issue.**

3. **Future 2026-27 rates already visible.** The government has already announced:
   - Tax rate cut: 16% -> 15% from 1 July 2026
   - Medicare levy threshold increases from 1 July 2026
   - MLS/PHI income threshold increases from 1 July 2026 ($105k singles, $210k families)
   
   These should be added to `TAX_CONFIG` when the 2026-27 year is implemented.

4. **SAPTO is not modelled in the app.** The app has a "Medicare Exempt" toggle but does not model SAPTO eligibility or the associated Medicare levy reductions for seniors. This is a feature gap, not a data gap.

## Gap Research — Medicare Levy Family Thresholds (CRITICAL BUG)

**Discovery:** The app's Medicare levy family thresholds are incorrect in **both** year configs. They use 2023-24 values instead of the current 2024-25+ values.

### Current (WRONG) values in code

```javascript
// Both 2024-2025 and 2025-2026 configs have:
MEDICARE_LEVY_THRESHOLD_FAMILY: 40939,        // 2023-24 value
MEDICARE_LEVY_PHASE_IN_UPPER_FAMILY: 51174,  // 2023-24 value
MEDICARE_LEVY_FAMILY_CHILD_ADJUSTMENT: 3760   // 2023-24 value
```

### Correct values (2024-25 and 2025-26)

| Constant | Current (Wrong) | Correct | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MEDICARE_LEVY_THRESHOLD_FAMILY` | 40,939 | **45,907** | ATO myTax 2025, William Buck, CPA Australia |
| `MEDICARE_LEVY_PHASE_IN_UPPER_FAMILY` | 51,174 | **57,383** | ATO myTax 2025, William Buck, CPA Australia |
| `MEDICARE_LEVY_FAMILY_CHILD_ADJUSTMENT` | 3,760 | **4,216** | ATO myTax 2025, William Buck, CPA Australia |

**Legislative basis:** The Treasury Laws Amendment (More Cost of Living Relief) Act 2025 (Royal Assent 27 March 2025) set these thresholds for "2024-25 and later income years." The single thresholds ($27,222 / $34,027) are already correct in the code — only the family values are wrong.

**Impact:** Families with taxable income between $40,939-$45,907 are incorrectly assessed as owing the full 2% Medicare levy when they should receive a reduction. Families with dependent children get a per-child adjustment of $3,760 instead of the correct $4,216, compounding the error.

## Gap Research — SAPTO Full Reference

### SAPTO Amounts and Thresholds (2025-26)

Unchanged from 2024-25. Source: ATO SAPTO page (last updated 14 November 2025).

| Status | Maximum Offset | Shading-Out Threshold | Cut-Out Threshold |
|---|---|---|---|
| Single | $2,230 | $34,919 | $52,759 |
| Each partner (living together) | $1,602 | $30,994 | $43,810 |
| Each partner (illness separated) | $2,040 | $33,732 | $50,052 |

- Reduction rate: **12.5c ($0.125) per dollar** of rebate income above shading-out threshold, rounded up
- Couple combined cut-out: $87,620 (2 x $43,810)

### SAPTO + LITO Effective Tax-Free Thresholds

| Situation | Effective Tax-Free Threshold |
|---|---|
| Not eligible for SAPTO or LITO | $18,200 |
| LITO only | $22,575 |
| SAPTO + LITO (single) | $35,813 |
| SAPTO + LITO (partnered, not separated) | $31,888 |
| SAPTO + LITO (illness separated) | $34,625 |

### SAPTO-Specific Medicare Levy Thresholds

| Category | No Levy Below | Full 2% Levy Above |
|---|---|---|
| Regular singles | $27,222 | $34,027 |
| SAPTO-eligible singles | $43,020 | $53,775 |
| Regular families | $45,907 | $57,383 |
| SAPTO-eligible families | $59,886 | $74,857 |
| Per dependent child | $4,216 (lower) | $5,270 (upper) |

Note: The SAPTO Medicare levy thresholds were **indexed up** from 2024-25 (e.g., SAPTO singles went from $41,089 to $43,020). The SAPTO offset amounts and rebate income thresholds themselves did not change.

### Eligibility Criteria

- Must receive (or qualify for) an eligible government payment: Age Pension, Carer Payment, DSP (if age-pension age), DVA pension, etc.
- Self-funded retirees who have reached Age Pension age and would qualify (but are excluded by income/assets test) are also eligible
- Centrelink Age Pension: must be 67+ on 30 June of the income year
- DVA pensions: must be 60+ and meet veteran pension age test
- Must be Australian resident for tax purposes
- Unused SAPTO can transfer between spouses

### App Gap

The app currently has a "Medicare Exempt" toggle but does not:
- Model SAPTO eligibility or the offset calculation
- Apply SAPTO-specific Medicare levy thresholds
- Calculate effective tax-free thresholds for seniors

This is a feature gap that would benefit senior users significantly (effective tax-free threshold nearly doubles from $22,575 to $35,813).

| Age | Base | Tier 1 | Tier 2 | Tier 3 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Under 65 | 24.118% | 16.079% | 8.038% | 0% |
